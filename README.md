# Enhanced_insertion_sort
Insertion sort using binary search to find position to reduce time complexity.
we know insertion sort takes more time. 
To solve this i am using binary search to find position of element in sorted list.
so i can reduce some time to find the correct position for element to insert.
I hope this code will help you.
Thank you.
